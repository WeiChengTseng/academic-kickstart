abstract: The capability of accurate prediction of protein functions and properties is essentialin the biotechnology industry, e.g. drug development and artificial protein synthesis,etc. The main challenges of protein function prediction are the large label spaceand the lack of labeled training data. Our method leverages unsupervised sequenceembedding and the success of deep convolutional neural network to overcome these challenges. In contrast, most of the existing methods delete the rare proteinfunctions to reduce the label space. Furthermore, some existing methods requireadditional bio-information (e.g., the 3-dimensional structure of the proteins) whichis difficult to be determined in biochemical experiments. Our proposed methodsignificantly outperforms the other methods on the publicly available benchmarkusing only protein sequences as input.  This allows the process of identifyingprotein functions to be sped up.
